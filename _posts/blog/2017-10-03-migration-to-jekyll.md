So.

After lazing around for a whole summer, I finally decided to pack my bags and leave WordPress. While WordPress is fantastic because I don't need to constantly type stupid tags (there's probably a better way to write these posts than on Atom), I figured making my own blog would be better, for reasons such as being able to host my own domain name and add my own customization.

It ended up being a pretty good learning experience, building my own theme on Jekyll. Thankfully, it wasn't too complicated. I do plan on expanding on this blog and making it better looking, but for now, it's time to upload some posts. And sleep.

Mostly, sleep.
