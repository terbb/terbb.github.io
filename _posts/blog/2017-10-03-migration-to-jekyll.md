So.

After lazing around for a whole summer, I finally decided to pack my bags and leave WordPress. While WordPress is fantastic because I don't need to constantly type stupid tags (there's probably a better way to write these posts than on Atom), I figured making my own blog would be better, for reasons such as being able to host my own domain name and add my own customization.

It ended up being a pretty good learning experience, building my own theme on Jekyll. Thankfully, it wasn't too complicated. I do plan on expanding on this blog and making it better looking, but for now, it's time to upload some posts. And sleep.

Mostly, sleep.

You'll also notice that I've changed my writing style and re-written my old posts to reflect the change. The reason why is because I feel like they were lacking some of my usual humour, probably because I was too busy trying to make my posts appropriate for future employers to read. As someone who was the official class clown for his junior high yearbook (I wore a rainbow afro and a pirate hook for the picture), humour, and being true to myself, is important to me.

So go out there and enjoy my posts. (Or don't.)
