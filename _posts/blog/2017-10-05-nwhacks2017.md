##### EXPERIENCE:

I was also featured on CockroachDB's website - you can view the blog post [here](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/hackathon-wins-nwhacks-2017/).

One brisk day in March, I headed over to UBC for the one and only nwHacks2017, hosted by North Western people, for North Western people. Let's give it up for everyone located relatively North and West!

Right after registering, we were ushered into a hall for the opening ceremony, which was definitely the most memorable part of the event, being full of hype and good cheer. The speakers and the hosts did a really good job of getting everyone excited early in the morning.

#### Using cockroachDB:

One of the speakers also talked about how since most people make two big mistakes a year, you should take risks - I can't exactly remember how the two were related, but I remember feeling inspired to use CockroachDB as our database of choice. I think the cash reward for winning the <b>Best Node.js App using CockroachDB</b> award may have had a small part to do with it.	

Unfortunately, I was ill-prepared, as I had barely taken a software engineering course, so I wasn't aware of how servers, clients and databases were related to eachother. This led to a very lengthy time spent merely installing the database on a virtual instance using AWS. I likely would have saved a lot more time not using an AWS, as there were a lot of troubles with allowing IP's to access the database, when it likely could have been easier hosting off a local machine.

I do remember being especially depressed for a large majority of the night, as my only contribution could be summed up in one line: `cockroach start`. 

#### The beginning of the end:

Surprisingly, I was able to host the app on Heroku. This largely confused me at the time because we were grouping both "client-side" and "server-side" code into one repository, so it seemed illogical for us to host the "client-side" code on Heroku. Looking back on it, it seems like the client was constructed using pure, vanilla HTML, CSS and JS, so I believe it was okay for us to upload the entire thing to Heroku as it only detects the Node.js code in the "server-side" folder.

Finally, when morning hit, it was time to present. Despite having only one table, the CockroachDB guys were impressed with our app, much of which I have to attribute to my friend Ryan.

We ended up winning <b>Best Node.js App using CockroachDB</b>, which was a pleasant surprise. As a less pleasant surprise, I was eventually billed $1000 or so after 1 month because I had forgotten to turn off my AWS virtual instance. Remember to turn off your instances kids.
