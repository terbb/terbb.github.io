Organizers at the Vancouver Comic Arts Festival invited game developers to sit themselves in a section called the "Indie Game Arcade" and allow people to play their games for free.

One notable part of the experience was how many different kinds of people played our game. From parents to kids, to other fellow game developers, all kinds of people expressed their frustration and joy at Paper Cut. 

Actually, funnily enough, the kids picked up the game faster than some adults (I remember one person who couldn't understand that bigger numbers meant bigger shapes). It was neat watching them play. Someone also got 3200 as a high score, which was pretty impressive (for the time).

I was very thankful for this experience because it brought a huge benefit: the critique and feedback of players. Many people gave us awesome feedback on how to improve the game. As a developer, sometimes you don't see the flaws in your game until an outsider tells you. For example, I never thought that the way our game presented the shapes was confusing. A 4x5 rectangle is obviously 4 inches wide and 5 inches tall, right? Well, no. It could be 4 inches deep and 5 inches wide. Or so someone told me.

Finally, I really enjoyed playing Iron Tides and Celeste. And watching people enjoy playing Paper Cut was heart-warming. In the end, I also got to connect with some great indie developers, namely someone from Kestrel Games. If I ever have some more time or money in the future, getting to know the indie game developer scene more would be a lot of fun.
