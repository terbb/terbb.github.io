##### EXPERIENCE:

Like all other hackathons, I departed for Eduhacks in the brisk 'morn. For breakfast, I stuffed my face with TacoTime nachos beacuse I was feeling especially frisky this particular morning. I definitely would not recommend this particular route of action. The cheese made me feel a little sick.

After arriving to the Vancouver Convention Centre, we discussed ideas to develop. One of them was a game about simulating a day in the life of a teacher. As you know, I like games, and having just developed one, I felt particularly attracted to this one.

The next order of business was finding 2 other programmers, so we posted on Slack and scrounged around till we found two more.

#### A rocky start

After that, it was time to get down to business. We envisioned a Pokemon style-like game, which mean it needed tilesets, and a character that could move around. 4 hours later, I finally managed to get both up and running, which was a great success, if it weren't for the fact that every 120 frames, the game would lag for a solid second. I could feel myself starting to sweat a little bit.

I had made a mistake. I grossly overestimated my competence in Lua. 

At this moment, a flash of inspiration came to me. There did exist an engine out there somewhere. One by the name of "RPG Maker", which was literally built for making RPGs. And since we were making a style in the game of Pokemon, what better engine for the job?

#### The switch

By the time we had made the switch, it was very late. It was already 7:50pm, and we had yet to actually start developing the game. At this point, I just decided to do anything I could to push the development forward, progressing bit by bit. First, the map. Then, the NPC. Afterwards, adding in dialogue.

I worked all the way till 6:00am, adding in dialogue portraits, programming a plugin to display a "success bar" on the top left, putting in Smashville as the title music and scripting in gameover events. 

After a 2-hour nap, I woke up, and continued scripting, adding in randomly spawning students and the ability to drink coffee and enter in grades. At this time, I could feel the adrenaline rushing - there were still so many bugs to try and fix.

#### Worth it?

Finally, we submitted it. Honestly, I didn't expect anything. It felt incomplete and technically much weaker than other projects. Still, I was happy to have some sort of project finished.

Later, we discovered that we made it to the final presentation, which really surprised me. I was happy, but I think I was so tired that it was hard to really be happy. I think in my mind, I was thinking "oh, more work," or something along the lines, since it meant we had to present and stay till the end.

Thankfully, it did end up being worth it, since we ended up winning **2nd Place**. This, I really didn't expect, but I'm really happy that we won anyways.

If I'm being brutally honest, I believe that the idea itself carried the win, so I believe my teammate, Jane, deserves the most respect.
