#### Isn't this obvious?

Well, yeah, it is. But it never struck me just how essential a team was until I had the opportunity of working on **Stela** at **Skybox Labs** (which, by the way, is releasing soon, so keep your eyes open for it on Xbox and Apple Arcade!)

A team is essential, not only just for delegating the different aspects of the game, such as art, game design or narrative, but also, from an engineering perspective. As programmers and humans, we are subject to much pain alone. For one, tackling a tough problem by yourself is always a difficult effort. And secondly, we are bound to make stupid mistakes, whether it's forgetting an `#include` or failing to declare something in a header - and mistakes like this, however
small, take time to hunt down, and only take away from our precious time we need to think about problems.

But with the help of a team, both of these probems can be made much easier. And this is why I'm saying your teammates are essential. Not just for splitting work, but for the fact that harnessing two perspectives is often much more effective than using our dumb, human, single track mind!

#### Yeah, when I'm stuck, I ask for help. Duh

Of course you do. I do. But I'm talking about problem solving that's much more than that. I'm talking about tackling problems that not even your teammates know.

The first few months I spent at Skybox, I spent them tackling these kinds of problems alone. Of course, I felt complete and utter *despair*. It was due to the fact that I was running into the classic **To solve X, I should solve Y**, when in fact, **Y is not even relevant to solving X**. I would hide details from my teammates, ask them about smaller problems I knew they knew how to solve, and then go about my merry way, only to discover that it would not solve **X**.

Recently, I've discovered that ironically, giving your teammates the whole picture, and therefore a bigger problem to solve, is **more useful than giving them small details to solve.** This has to be accompanied by your thoughts on how to approach the problem, of course, but by doing this, you're able to gain your teammate's thoughts and perspective on how to solve the problem, and that, is actually far more useful than you realize.

You see, by doing this and discussing your thoughts out loud with another human being, you can begin to brainstorm solutions to the problem. Approaches that you may not even realize exist, or approaches sparked by your teammate's intuition, may reveal themselves to you. And, approaches that you think may work, but actually don't, may be crossed out by your own realization or, your teammate's experience.

Doing this is far more effective than suffering on your own and using your teammates as living search engines - it's the power of discussion, interaction, thinking out loud. It's the power of leveraging two people's minds, the **power of the sum being greater than it's parts**.

That's why, when I'm programming at work and solving a problem, I'm talking to people more often than not, granted, if they're not busy, and I have something useful to say. It's really weird, because at my previous job, I could go a whole day without talking to anyone. This job is much more technically challenging, yet, I can go a whole day **just talking to people**!

Actually, that's why I've begun to think that whiteboarding in technical interviews actually kind of make sense. Interviewers want to see if you have this skill of being able to play off another person. Communication and being able to share your thoughts plays an essential part in this, but really, it's also about you being
able to exchange a meaningful dialogue with another person, not just about being able to outpace someone with your words.

Of course, teammates acting as human search engines is pretty good, provided you actually know how to solve the problem you're solving.

#### Human search engines... and spell checkers

Compilation errors do a pretty good job of telling us where we messed up, but often times, it's much smoother having another human beside you double-checking all your work. I'm talking about pair programming.

I've started to do this, especially now when the whole team needs to band together to take down some really important bugs before our release, and I've found it extremely effective for just keeping programming progress smooth. At least, I feel like my presence has been effective for another engineer at my work (haha).

Thing is, whenever you make a dumb mistake like typing the wrong function name, by pressing `Run` and having things not work, and having to spend that moment of time thinking *"what the heck happened?"*, is actually pretty disruptive to your train of thought. Well, maybe not as dramatic as I'm making it out to be, but it sure helps to stay in the zone when you aren't having to switch tracks constantly, solving tiny, small problems when you're really just trying to tackle the one big problem
you're focused on.

Plus, it feels a lot more reassuring to have a sanity checker. During critical times like now, when we're rushing to fix things right before release, one small mistake can **cost a lot**. Even if the programming you're doing is simple, it helps a lot to just have another person look over it with their eyes and say *"this seems ok to me."* It's the reason why we have merge requests in the first place.

#### In short, engineers need to work together, too

In my programming career, I'm used to doing things alone, even when working with a team. I rarely discuss my problems with other people, and I rarely pair program with other people. And I think it's the same for a lot of other people. We blindly shove in merge requests, and just simply look at the end result of eachother's code!

That's why I used to think that when software engineering jobs looked for people with a strong ability to work with a team, I used to think it was because they would need to work with other people who are **not** engineers. While that's important too, I realize it's also because engineers are so much better together than alone. 

I know that there's no way I could have kept my sanity intact without my fellow engineers. They're my partners in crime - when I'm stuck and pulling out my hair, they offer me a different perspective. When I need someone to check over the stupid code I've written and to warn me about making a function static, they're there to, well, warn me. And when I really need a drinking buddy after a really long week at work with a ton of overtime, well, thankfully, they're there with a cold
beer in hand.

**Don't underestimate the value of a great team**, even as a software engineer!
