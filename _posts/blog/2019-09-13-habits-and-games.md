#### The dealio

Last month, I won a Super Smash Bros. Ultimate novice tournament at Vancouver Street Battle, and participating was a ton of fun. During that time, I had been playing and thinking about Smash quite often. Either I would be watching videos, taking notes, or playing at lunch.

Habits like this aren't uncommon for me. It's quite often that when I focus on something, I put all my attention into it. And with games, it's especially easy for me to get caught onto something. For example, if I am into League of Legends at that moment, I'll spend hours practicing advanced techniques on Yasuo in the practice tool, or thinking about how to play certain match-ups. Eventually, I immerse myself so deeply into a game, that I usually can get pretty good at playing it.

It's then that I feel the most satisfied - when I feel like I'm completely caught up in something. It's almost like, because I'm so involved, I can appreciate every detail and intricacy I come across, and because I can appreciate those small things, I continue to polish my skills and hunt for those tiny ways that I can get better, and it just continues to snowball.

But today, I went to another novice tournament at Vancouver Street Battle. Since the last time I played, I had barely touched Smash at all, regularly putting my hours into BYTEPATH mini and programming. Not surprisingly, I played pretty bad, since I was rusty. But the one thing that shocked me the most was that I **didn't enjoy playing as much as I did last time.**

Whether I won or I lost, I didn't feel particularly excited about whatever the outcome of the match was. It was almost like I couldn't even be bothered to try. And I was really surprised, because usually I do enjoy the thrill of competing in a game, and even when I'm not competing, I just enjoy playing the game and pulling off cool moves. But I didn't feel any of that. I wondered to myself, *"why?"*

It wasn't just Ultimate either - I was experiencing this when I was playing Overwatch, and League of Legends.

#### My history with games

I've been playing games ever since I was a little kid. And when I say little, I mean *little*. My earliest memory was when I attempted to do Roy's Up-B in pre-school and I almost hit another girl. Around the age of 8, I started playing Warcraft 3, and I remember being particularly shocked when my friends didn't know what a Death Knight was.

I know, nerdy. But more importantly, I've always had a really strong relationship with games. So, I never thought a day would come when I'd feel even a little bit apathetic towards playing games.

#### The twist

One thing I've come to realize, though, is that I haven't necessarily become apathetic towards games, but towards competitive video games. And the reason behind that is really simple. I've stopped the habit of playing for so long, let alone competing, that I've begun forgetting my feelings towards it.

On the other hand, when it comes to programming, I've become especially passionate, whereas before, even though I enjoyed programming, I **never saw it as a hobby.** I always saw it as a necessity, either for school, or for work. I always found it difficult to program on my own time. And it's the same for making games - I never had the patience to actually sit down and grind through making a game, but now, it's much easier for me to develop a game and appreciate making/programming one, than
it is to play one.

And the reason for that, is of course, the same. I've just been doing it so much more that it's hard for me to not start appreciating it.

#### Which begs the question...

How malleable are we exactly, as humans? 

I was once a person who could have never imagined developing a game or programming. I thought that I would always remain a player. Yet, I've curiously just experienced the complete opposite, all thanks to the habits I've begun developing. So this has come to make me believe that no matter what kind of people we are, we can change, as long as we continue to preservere and repeat the things that we want to be.

And this is both a good thing, and a bad thing. On one hand, it gives me hope to know that I can always change, no matter who I am, which means that I can always overcome negative aspects of myself. And I can explore more parts of myself that I never knew. 

On the other hand, it means that even good parts of ourselves are subject to change. We have to be ever dilligent in maintaining the best parts of ourselves, or we might lose it to the abyss. What's more, it also means that we might lose core parts of our identity, without even knowing it.

#### So, about those habits... 

It's a bit scary to think that we as humans are merely just an amalgamation of our habits. And sometimes, these habits aren't even consciously made - sometimes, they're a result of either our environment, or our genetics. Which looks bleak. Is the self we know really our true self, or is it the result of just how we've been all this time? If that's the case, if we spend time in a crappy environment, won't that mean we'll be a crappy version of ourselves?

I personally believe the answer is yes. But I think that all is not bleak. The power of perspective can change a lot. By constantly taking the time to question, and reflect, and just **consciously** decide what to do - I think it gives us some power over the people we want to be. After all, if we're choosing which habits we create, we can choose the people that we want to be.

#### So, where am I going?

Knowing this and experiencing what I felt yesterday, I've come to realize that I feel surprisingly okay about starting to feel more apathetic about competing in games, and the reason is just because I've done it for so long. I'm a person who always like to experience something new, and I've really come to enjoy how exciting and fresh programming can be, especially when developing games, simply because you're always facing off against new problems. In other words, I want to continue
this habit of programming, and not playing games (at least, competitive ones.)

It's very interesting to feel this way because this is a new kind of me that I'm not used to. Normally, I would try and get back into Ultimate, but this time it seems that my habits have really changed my perspective. It makes me think, maybe it becomes easier to change some habits, once you've changed others? 

Who knows. At the very least, becoming more conscious of the habits I'm beginning to develop, makes me feel like I'm more in control of the person that I want to be. I think if I wasn't as conscious, I would feel that there's something uncontrollably "wrong" with me, just because something is different than normal, when in reality, my habits are just changing. If I wanted to be the "me" who loved competing in Ultimate, I'm confident that I could be, as long as I started rebooting those habits
up. 

Extrapolating even further, it feels a little comforting knowing that the person who I am today is (mostly) a result of the choices I've made. So here's to hopefully continuing becoming the person I want to be!
