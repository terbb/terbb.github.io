#### Last time, on Dragonball Z

My last blog post was about how the habits we choose to cultivate determine who we are as people. Well, maybe not entirely, but they play a big part in who we are. So, this blog post is about some good habits that I've begun building, with the topic being productivity!

#### Don't tell anyone what you're working on.

This is an interesting one. The credits go to this <a href="https://blog.trello.com/science-backed-reasons-you-shouldnt-share-your-goals">article</a> for the idea.

You can read the article why, but to paraphrase (one specific reason), sharing your goals makes it less likely for you to actually follow through on your goals. Why? Because by simply sharing your goals to someone else, and hearing praise from that person, you feel like you've already "accomplished" your goal. You feel good without actually having done anything.

Now, this might be different if you're someone who generates energy from hearing praise, but for me, I... yeah, I just end up feeling good without actually having really done anything, it seems, because when I started keeping my projects a little more secret from my friends and family, and keeping it in my brain, I noticed that I started to get a LOT more done, consistently.

Perhaps it's because I'm driven by the idea that there will be a "reward" at the end - there will be praise and recognition at the end of the tunnel, and I just need to finish my project in order to get there. If I've already gotten it, why finish it? That's basically the idea. So try it, if you feel like you identify with that sentiment.

Of course, I still share a little bit, but just not as much now.

#### Get used to biting the bullet. 

Before, I would often make a lot of excuses to do stuff before doing the actual thing I needed to do, like, say, homework. For example, I would say to myself, "oh, I'll just play one game" or "oh, I'll just read this one manga" before actually going ahead and doing what I needed to do.

As a result this would dramatically decrease the time I had to actually do what I wanted, so now I do the opposite. I bite the bullet, and just start working on whatever I need to work on, no matter how little I feel like working on it. And often times that ends up being a lot better, because, well, it's the thing you need to do!

It feels awful and difficult at first, but once you do it consistently, you're almost moved by a force unknown to you to just start doing it anyways. Having done this enough times, it's literally become muscle memory to just open up whatever I need to start doing and start doing it. And even though I always hate it for the first ten minutes, I feel like I've become so numbed to the pain that I don't even notice it anymore.

#### Set a single goal for yourself, every work session.

A tactic people really like to use is the "Pomodoro timer". But personally, I'm someone who works best when he can get obsessed with something for a long period of time, so taking breaks for me is really disruptive. At the same time, it felt bad not to have measured units of my work - that's the one thing I really liked about that strategy - the fact that I could count how many pomodoros I had at the end and feel good. Plus, it would be easy for me to burn out when I didn't quantify my work,
because I wouldn't know when to stop!

So I began to set one simple rule for myself: set a single goal for a work session, and finish it. That way, I would have the best of both worlds. I could work without stopping, and, quantify the work that I have, which allowed me to be more focused, feel better about my work, and avoid burnout.

The most important part of this tactic is the scope of your goal. I always set my goals to be able to be finished in at most 1.5 hours, because I know that's how long I can work before I burn out.

Like this, I've been able to make steady progress on whatever I'm doing, just by setting one goal, and aiming to finish it, no matter what.

#### Do not do anything else while you are working.

Drinking water and taking bathroom breaks is fine, but I find that if I do something like checking my phone, browsing another website, or even drifting into space, thinking about other things, it absolutely destroys my concentration.

Destruction of concentration is brutal, and often times, irrecoverable, as destroying it makes it even easier to destroy the second time, and so on, and so on. Which is why I aim to never even think about other activities that disrupt my focus, as it makes finishing a single goal really hard!

So leave that stuff later, until you've at least finished your goal. That way, by the end, you can feel confident that you've at least finished what you need to do.

#### Take care of your mind, and body.

This is repeated everywhere, but the importance can't be understated. Keeping your body healthy by eating the right foods, sleeping at the right time, or exercising, helps maintain focus. If you're exhausted, it's that much harder to maintain patience and focus towards what you're working on.

For programming, patience and focus are absolutely essential. Often times, we must face brutal, unavoidable labor, when Google doesn't have the answers we want, which involves the creation of a hypothesis, testing it, then evaluating the results, which can wear down the mind and make one feel lost and frustrated. This might happen when say, you're getting a mysterious build error about the `armeabi-v7a` architecture not being supported, and no one knows on the internet knows why! It's times
like those when you're left
with little choice but to figure it out slowly by yourself.

If your mind isn't in tip-top shape, doing this will be a nightmare. So at the very least, **get enough sleep.**

#### When in doubt, just MOVE.

This is a really important one. Often times, I've faced problems that seem completely insurmountable. I think of a few possible solutions, but all of them look either near impossible to accomplish, or don't seem to have any promise at all. At those times, my productivity grinds to a halt, and I end up sitting there, doing nothing.

This is the worst possible choice you can make. I'm not saying you should start coding without knowing where you're going at all. Programmers should always know where they're going before coding, otherwise you're just going to waste more time getting lost!

What I'm saying you need to do is **start moving in a productive way.** There are plenty of other actions you can take without directly coding the solution. One thing I always do that is always, always successful is to **always ask myself questions, and to start answering those questions.**

For example, if I'm stuck, I'll ask myself, *"why am I stuck?"*, and I'll answer that. Then, I'll ask, *"what do I need to do to become un-stuck?"*, and I'll answer that. Say the answer is, *"i'm stuck because I don't have enough information"*, then I'll start writing code to print things to give me more information. And I'll keep going, and going.

Just sitting there and saying, *"i'm stuck"*, will not help you. And I think this is especially important in technical interviews. You will face problems that are unbelievably hard. What the interviewer is looking for, is for you to get a grip on yourself and start moving in a productive manner, no matter how small the steps you take are, because you will undoubtedly face seemingly impossible problems when working on anything.

Once we start moving, we can start finding the answer, always, as long as we ask the right questions, and preservere.

#### Play the right music.

This one's mileage may vary between people, but I always make sure to choose the right music for whatever I'm working on. This is something you'll have to find for yourself through experimentation, though.

For me, I always make sure to choose **chillhop** whenever I'm working on something that requires me to write, for example, like this blog post. I'm a pretty lethargic person so I need my music to have some kind of beat or variance, otherwise I'll just fall asleep, but I also need music without lyrics, because lyrics will interrupt the words I'm trying to formulate in my brain. **chillhop** fits these two requirements perfectly. It's also a little less energetic than the songs I
usually pick, which is good since I find writing tends to be a more leisurely and creative activity than programming. Although, I'm starting to think it sounds like a pretty good fit for programming too.

Find the right music that best fits your work. If you feel uncomfortable or you're always changing the music, that's a sign that the music you have isn't really fitting you. And speaking of which, curate a playlist so you can better get into the zone and avoid having to change the music all the time!

#### Listen to your intuition.

Often times, our gut instinct can give us a hint or a clue as to where we should go when we are lost, and it pays to listen to it, even in extremely logical activities like programming.

For example, when I was presenting on **how to calculate the intersection of 2 convex hulls**, the professor asked me how the runtime would change depending on the number of intersections in the shape. I thought about it for a little bit, and I said *"it doesn't change"*, when I suddenly felt like I was rushing head-first into a trap. After that, I said *"wait, let me think about it"*, and I began testing more cases that I hadn't considered before, and I discovered that it did, indeed
change!

Another good example is when an interviewer asked me about how virtual tables needing 2 function pointers in C++ would affect the performance of code. During that time, I had absolutely no idea. But my intuition guided me to think about what the interviewer said about 2 function pointers specifically. I knew instinctively that that part he mentioned was important - and that's when I knew the reason was due to cache misses.

After solving so many problems, my intuition had been honed to the point where I could just sense that something was wrong - and indeed, I use this ability a lot, for example, to point me in the right direction and save myself from jumping down a hopeless rabbit hole when I'm trying to fix a bug.

So use your intuition. You can train yourself to listen to it by just starting to become aware of everything. Observe every little detail in your own mind, body, and surroundings, and you'll find yourself being able to notice things you weren't able to before.

### And that's all for now, folks

Usually my blog posts are a lot shorter than this, but this time, I had a lot of habits to reflect about. These are habits that have served me really well, so if you find that any of them might be useful to you, please, go ahead and use them!
