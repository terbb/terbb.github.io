#### Another post about Vancouver Street Battle

Yep, I know I just finished writing about the Smash Ultimate tournament at VSB, but I wanted to dedicate a short, separate post about commentating the games there. In short (heh), it was very fun.

I suspect the reason why is because I'm a very detail-oriented person. I really like pointing out specific things, and commentating provides a really nice platform for me to share my thoughts on my observations. Plus, it feels good to guide viewers through things that they may not notice or understand with my experience of the game.

**Unless you play the game, you won't be able to understand the next part. Sorry, it's just too difficult to explain everything.**

#### Banjo vs DDD

A good example of this was when I was commentating a match with **Banjo vs DDD**. When I saw the player playing DDD use a lot of Gordo's, I commented on how it seemed to be paying off for him, since typically the way to play around it is to either jump around it, or hit it back at him, but Banjo is a very slow and floaty character who can't easily maneuver in the air, and has very weak and laggy aerials that make it hard for him to hit it back at DDD.

That kind of matchup insight is what I crave from commentary and what I think I do best at supplying, since I feel like I'm able to find certain details and figure out their influence on the bigger picture. 

I also really like diving into why player's decide to pick a certain move, for example, when the Banjo started using his *Side-B* very frequently, I noted that it was likely because he was at very high percent and likely to die, so he wanted to use his feathers to tack on extra percent
before he died.

Another thing I like to do is talk about what a player might decide to look for in a certain situation. For example, when in an *Inkling vs Luigi* match, I noticed that *Up-Smash* out of shield was a favorite option of the Inkling's, due to being both reliable and powerful. When Luigi reached high enough percent, I would point out how the Inkling player would start fishing for that option, and how the Luigi player needs to play safe and use projectiles like his *Zair* and his fireballs to zone out
that option.

#### My weaknesses as a commentator

Although I feel like I'm good at observing details and analyzing why player's decide to do a certain action or what exactly they want to look for at any given moment in a match, I discovered that I'm not really good at hyping up the situation.

I think it's because personally, I love analyzing the game too much to even try and hype up the crowd in the meantime, and I discovered when I was paired with my coworker as a commentator (who is really good at hyping up the game), we didn't match up that well, since my trains of thought were often too long and would get interrupted by his excitement. This is interesting, since I think I'm sometimes known as an "excited" and "hyped-up" person but my commentary is almost the exact
opposite of that.

Speaking of long trains of thought, I definitely need to work on finishing my thoughts quicker. Often times by the time I finish my thought, someone has already taken a stock. So I think it would be better if I was more in the present of the game rather than lagging behind.

Another bad habit I notice I have is pondering and asking questions in the middle of the match. As a viewer, I don't think it's very good if a commentator asks a question, because, well, you're supposed to be the source of knowledge! Of course, it's totally fine, as long as the commentator doesn't frequently do it and dwell on the questions for a long time. But in my case, I did that a few times, so I'd like to completely erase that habit of mine.

Going back to the "hype commentator" point, I do think it would be good if I did get a bit more excited by things, and if I was able to banter with my co-commentator a bit better. I didn't have much else to say about my partner's comments other than "yeah", so it would be cool if I could play off their thoughts a bit better.

#### My future as a commentator

Well, I don't particularly plan on actually pursuing commentary seriously, but it is a ton of fun to do, and something that I'm actually quite used to as well, since I've done a lot of public speaking. I would definitely do it again, and I'd be interesting to do more public-facing activities like this, such as making videos or streaming. It seems I'm already doing more of that, though, since I've recently been blogging a lot more. On that note, it's interesting because I've typically spend a
lot of my time alone, programming, but now I'm making a small shift to activities that engage with other people. 

By the way, if you'd like me to commentate anything, don't hesitate to send me an email. I'm just an amateur, though. haha
