**Winner of Volunteer's Choice - First Place!!**

Paper Cut is a game about cutting the right shapes of paper to please your boss until you run out of time. The more accurate you are at cutting the dimensions he requests for, the more points you get!

Get more points to add more time, but be careful, as the shapes that the boss requests you to cut will become more varied and difficult. You might even be required to cut ovals!

This was built using the LOVE2D game engine, and written using Lua.

**10/10/2017 -** Version 1.1 has been released. This version has minor gameplay changes and bug fixes.

```
- You MUST click and hold in order to draw the shape. If you let go of the mouse in the middle of drawing a shape, it is scored immediately.
- The feedback from the boss, as well as the correct shape, only lasts for 1.5 seconds now before another problem appears.
- The shape that you drew on screen no longer stays indefinitely.
- The boss now asks you for a problem immediately when you start the game.
```

**02/10/2017 -** - The game was created at BC Game Jam 2017.
