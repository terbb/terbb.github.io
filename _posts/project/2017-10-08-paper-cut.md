#### Summary:

Paper Cut is a game about cutting the right shapes of paper to please your boss until you run out of time. The more accurate you are at cutting the dimensions he requests for, the more points you get!

Get more points to add more time, but be careful, as the shapes that the boss requests you to cut will become more varied and difficult. You might even be required to cut ovals!

Originally made in 48 hours at **BC Game Jam 2017**, I re-factored and re-built the game from the ground up, and released it for the Play Store in September 2018. Now with:

- 3 new shapes
- 64 new achievements
- 7 new items with unique gameplay effects
- 2 new modes 

Built using the LOVE2D game engine, and written with Lua.

#### Notable Achievements:
* **Led a team of 3 to win 1st place at BC Game Jam 2017 in 48 hours.**
* **Re-factored the entire game and ported it to the Play Store.**
* Wrote code to scale up the game to any resolution.
* Optimized Lua code by using a third-party library to profile, and by minimizing function calls and using the `local` keyword.

**10/10/2017 -** Version 1.1 has been released. This version has minor gameplay changes and bug fixes.

```
- You MUST click and hold in order to draw the shape. If you let go of the mouse in the middle of drawing a shape, it is scored immediately.
- The feedback from the boss, as well as the correct shape, only lasts for 1.5 seconds now before another problem appears.
- The shape that you drew on screen no longer stays indefinitely.
- The boss now asks you for a problem immediately when you start the game.
```
