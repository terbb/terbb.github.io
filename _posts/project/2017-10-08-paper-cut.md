### Description:

Paper Cut is a game about cutting the right shapes of paper to please your boss until you run out of time. The more accurate you are at cutting the dimensions he requests for, the more points you get!

Get more points to add more time, but be careful, as the shapes that the boss requests you to cut will become more varied and difficult. You might even be required to cut ovals!
