#### Summary:

Teacher for a Day is a game meant to simulate what it's like to live a day in the life of a teacher, as people outside of the field of education are often unaware of what it is teachers really do. 

Occasionally, students will spawn inside the classroom, and will need you, the teacher to look after them! Talk to them to initiate a conversation, and make sure you select the right dialogue to gain success points, or fail by letting your success bar drop to 0!

This was built using RPG Maker MV, and the plugin code was written in Javascript.
